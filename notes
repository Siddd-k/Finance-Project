2 cases to be handled for splitting the list at 0.5 fibb level
    case 1:
    last portion of data is ingnored
    
    case 2:
    the market is moving sideways
    if we have 3-4 points in the given range, we have to group them rather than splitting the list
    Approach:
    check for the difference near mean point
    if the point lies in the range and the consecutive difference is less than 10
     




Fibbonaci Strategy

procedure:
    define the 0.5 level, it our break even point 
    group the preceding data at the break even point 
        expectional cases:
        -the market is moving sideways 
        -data succeeding the breakeven point 
    vectorise the group
    compare it's cosine similarity for 5 different cases
